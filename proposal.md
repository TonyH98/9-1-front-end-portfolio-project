### User Stories
- As a user I'll be able to see multiple links that I can freely navigate to. 
- As a user I'll be able to go to the About link and read about who developed the web page 
- As a user I should be able to see a default anime quote from the API 
- As a user I should be able to look up anime quote either typing a character name or anime title into the input box 
- As a user if I leave the input box empty or I type in character name or title that the api does not have I should get an error message
